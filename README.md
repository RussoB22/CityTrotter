# City Slicker

## App Description
City Slicker is an intercity travel app enabling users to plug in current 
location information and destination location information to get a 
visualization of the route via map, the distance between locations, the 
amount of time it takes to travel as well as the current weather of the 
destination. It also allows users to generate a list of mulitple destinations 
so they can plan their day accordingly and using this capability provides 
an additional metric which is the total amount of time spent traveling. Additionally,
users can also use the mangifying glass icon to find suggested destinations based on 
the area they are interested in traveling to.
